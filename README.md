# Interpreting Colleges’ Roles in Social Mobility Based on Student and Family Demographics and Colleges’ Societal Contributions

## Background 

Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels recently [published an article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/why-we-ended-legacy-admissions-johns-hopkins/605131/?utm_source=feed) in The Atlantic earlier this month announcing that Johns Hopkins now has more Pell grant-eligible students than Johns Hopkins legacy students after eliminating legacy favorability from the admissions process in 2014. Daniels cites a few research studies that illustrate how a university legacy system can hinder top universities from matriculating a more diverse student body, and, therefore, that JHU’s new policy underlines their commitment to promoting social mobility and granting broader education opportunities to minority, low-income, and other underrepresented groups. 

While this appears to be a step [in the right direction](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/opinion/sunday/end-legacy-college-admissions.html) “to make a Johns Hopkins education accessible to all talented students, to mitigate the burdens of debt, and to ensure that students receive the supports and services that will help them thrive,” how will we know if Johns Hopkins (or any university) has been successful in these efforts? We’ll take a look at open data that the [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) group produced for their [research](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf) (summary [here](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/coll_mrc_summary.pdf
)) analyzing higher education’s role in upward mobility, to further approximate how colleges might want to analyze and interpret their own data

### *__How can Johns Hopkins University know if their recent decision to end legacy preferences will better equip them to “educate [more] qualified and promising students from all backgrounds and to help launch them up the social ladder,” and what metrics should the university measure to monitor their progress?__*

1. [College Level Characteristics from the IPEDS Database and the College Scorecard](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=100&topic=0&paper_id=0#resource-listing) - mrc_table10; Opportunity Insights
2. [Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates of Child and Parent Income Distributions by College](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=100&topic=0&paper_id=0#resource-listing) - mrc_table02; Opportunity Insights

4. [School OPE ID Data](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/03122018-fws.pdf)

## Data Analysis
We’ll analyze: 
 - general college data regarding enrollment and expenditures per university tier
- parents’ and kids’ income data related to individual and different tiers of colleges and how colleges contribute to social mobility
- specific metrics related to Pell grant recipients to see how colleges can use this--or other--metric(s) to measure their social mobility impact
